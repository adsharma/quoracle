\TODO[michael]{Prove that for every read-write quorum system, there exists a coterie with at least as good load.}
\TODO[michael]{Prove that if P dominates Q, then P has equal or lower load.}
\TODO[michael]{The above shows that the optimal load quorum system is a non-dominated coterie. Maybe this is useful? We can generate every NDC?}
\TODO[michael]{Understand how domination relates to subsumption.}
\TODO[michael]{Understand dual-major, dual-minor, and self-dual.}
\TODO[michael]{Extend these notions to read-write quorums.}
\TODO[michael]{Enumerate all read-write quorums on four nodes and see the ones we can and can't subsume.}
\TODO[michael]{Prove that if I have the read quorums R, then the write quorums are bar(R).}
